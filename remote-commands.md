## Commands for Remotes

1. List all your remote repositories **and** show the URL of each remote:
   ```
   TODO write the git command for this
   ```

2. (Pushing a new branch) You commit some files to the `dev-foo` branch and try to "push" them to Github, but it fails as shown here:
   ```
   cmd>  git checkout dev-foo
   cmd>  git push
   fatal:  The current branch dev-foo has no upstream branch. 
   ```
   Explain this error.
   > TODO write your answer in lines beginning with `>` like this one, not triple-backquotes. The text will be formatted and may include Markdown.


3. The command to push `dev-foo` to `origin` as a **new remote branch** on `origin` is:
   ```
   todo
   ```


4. (Create a local tracking branch for a remote branch) The remote repository (`origin`) has a branch named `e2e-test` that you don't have in your local repository.   
   The command to create a new local branch as a copy of the remote `e2e-test` branch that **tracks** the remote branch is:
   ```
   TODO There are many commands that will do this.  You may write any one that works.
   ```

5. The command to change the URL of the remote "origin" to a new URL, such as `https://hostname/newuser/new-repo-name`, is:
   ```
   todo your answer
   ```
   This situation occurs when:
   - you change the name of a repo on Github
   - you transfer ownership of a Github repo to someone else
   - you move from Github to another hosting site, like Bitbucket or Gitlab
   - you want to switch from the https to the ssh protocol (the URL has a different format)

6. To create a *second* remote repository for your local repo, the command to add a remote named "bitbucket" with the URL "https://bitbucket.org/your-username/git-commands" is:
   ```
   todo your answer
   ```
   - This command just adds bitbucket as a remote, it won't create the remote repo. You must create it yourself.


7. After adding the remote named `bitbucket`, the command to push your master branch to `bitbucket` is:
   ```
   todo your answer
   ```
