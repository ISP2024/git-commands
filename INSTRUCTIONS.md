## Instructions

1. Read Chapters 2 & 3 of [Pro Git][ProGit]. The chapters are short.

2. Answer these questions using [Markdown format][markdown-cheatsheet] (also [Github Markdown][github-markdown]). 

3. Place your answers between lines beginning with 3 backquotes, which tells Markdown it should be unformatted text, and write only the commands you would type (**no** shell prompt).  E.g.:
   ```
   git status         CORRECT
   $ git status       WRONG  - you do not type "$"
   ```

4. Indent the 3 backquotes so they line up with the question text (3 leading spaces) so Markdown formats you answer as part of the numbered item.
   Example:
   ```
   git init
   ```  
5. Delete all **TODO** lines in the README file and other Markdown files.

5. **Test that your answers are correct!** There is **no excuse** for incorrect answers since you can verify your answers by experiment.      

6. Verify that your Markdown formatting is correct -- points deducted for bad formatting. VS Code and IntelliJ have markdown previewers. You should also preview it on Github, since Github Markdown is a bit non-standard.
